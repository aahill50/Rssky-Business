The deal was a tax inversion, a merger that would bring the new company\\u0026#8217;s headquarters out of the US—and out of reach of many US taxes. Thanks to the comparatively high US tax rate and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/255790/how-big-business-buys-the-right-to-dodge-us-taxes/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ea corporate tax code that privileges overseas cash\\u003C/a\\u003E and profit shifting, lots of companies—especially pharmaceutical firms, which have lots of intellectual property that can be that can be steered to low-tax jurisdictions—have been trying to take advantage of the structure.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut many US politicians are unhappy about the development, which erodes the American tax base. Last month, after Burger King found a tax-inversion opportunity that would move the fast-food chain\\u0026#8217;s headquarters to Canada, the Obama administration \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/269829/did-barack-obama-just-crack-down-on-tax-inversions-or-what/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Etightened the rules\\u003C/a\\u003E for companies seeking to complete these transactions. It wasn\\u0026#8217;t clear whether this would mean merely tinkering around the edges or having enough impact to prevent the deals from going through. AbbVie\\u0026#8217;s decision to cancel its merger shows that the provisions do have some teeth; it remains to be seen if the Burger King deal or other high-profile inversions, like those planned by Medtronic and Chiquita, will be affected.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGonzalez, who thought the tax impact of his merger was of secondary importance just months ago, is now agitating for full-scale corporate tax reform. With the Republican party expecting to control the US legislature after next month\\u0026#8217;s election, it\\u0026#8217;s likely that reform proposals intended to ease companies\\u0026#8217; efforts to shift earnings overseas will gain traction, but they will find it hard to pass them while Barack Obama is still president. A long-awaited tax reform plan will likely keep waiting, at least until the results of the 2016 elections are in, barring an unexpected willingness to compromise by either party.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=284639\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/284639/the-us-government-actually-stood-up-to-a-would-be-corporate-tax-dodger/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-10-21T09:55:10-04:00\",\"category\":\"Borders\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=284639\",\"dc_creator\":\"Tim Fernholz\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/us-keeper-save.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"US-keeper-save\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/us-keeper-save.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/284639/the-us-government-actually-stood-up-to-a-would-be-corporate-tax-dodger/"], ["published_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 13:55:10 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The US government actually stood up to a would-be corporate tax dodger"], ["updated_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 14:03:37 UTC +00:00]]

On the one hand, this is self-evident: Google\\u0026#8217;s business, like that of any other consumer-facing firm, rests entirely on its ability to attract hundreds of millions of people to its services, giving advertisers an audience and giving Google valuable data to mine in order to improve its services.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe definition of evil, then, rests on what would be bad for users. Or, to be more precise, on what Google thinks is bad for users. It would also, by extension, be bad for Google. The moral compass and the interests of the business point in the same direction.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn the other hand, what Google conceives of as \\u0026#8220;evil\\u0026#8221; is necessarily self-serving.

It\\u0026#8217;s a wonderful image to present to the world—that of a benign, even benevolent corporation striving only for its users, to whom it provides services free.

About half of India\\u0026#8217;s coal reserves—the fifth largest in the world—that is available above 600 meters is low-quality coal, former Coal India chairman S. Narsing Rao \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/should-coal-be-denationalised-112082900014_1.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Epointed out\\u003C/a\\u003E in 2012. \\u0026#8220;If the private sector, including multinational corporations, is allowed to mine coal for commercial purposes, it will probably stick to producing from areas that have a low cost of production and high quality of coal,\\u0026#8221; he argued.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince Jaitley wants to safeguard Coal India, it can\\u0026#8217;t exactly allow private firms into these lucrative coal assets and ask the state-run miner to look elsewhere.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMuch of India\\u0026#8217;s unexploited coal reserves lie in remote areas with inadequate transportation infrastructure. If private firms are asked to look at these assets, they will be forced to build expensive infrastructure to extract coal from these mines. This new transport infrastructure will then have to be linked with existing railway routes—that already moves about half of India\\u0026#8217;s coal—for further movement. Coordination between Coal India and the railways is already problematic, so adding private miners in the mix won\\u0026#8217;t make things any better.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMoreover, with Coal India selling coal at a subsidized price, it\\u0026#8217;s unclear how private firms will recover these large investments since pricing their coal according to international benchmarks will drive up cost for customers—primarily power, steel and cement sectors—who will then want to pass on the cost to the end-consumer. Industry is unlikely to react happily. And if the government forces miners to keep their prices low, private players can\\u0026#8217;t be expected to queue up.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn short, opening up the sector to private miners while fully safeguarding Coal India\\u0026#8217;s interests, is going to be a tightrope walk.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;In the current situation, it\\u0026#8217;s not right to get merchant miners into the sector,\\u0026#8221; an analyst told Quartz, requesting anonymity since the details of the policy aren\\u0026#8217;t public yet, \\u0026#8220;Till Coal India\\u0026#8217;s share (of the market) goes down, it is not possible in the next few years.\\u0026#8221; And reducing dependence on Coal India would primarily happen through an increase in captive mining.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat may be exactly what finance minister Jaitley intends on doing by streamlining the coal auction process—and by refusing to give a clear timeline on allowing private players.

He is the most famous brand India has produced. The boost to the country’s soft power through his statues and busts that dot public spaces across continents is not only huge, but also enduring. He has now lived in the hearts and mind of billions for nearly 80 years since his assassination. And by the looks of it, he isn’t fading away soon.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe “half-naked fakir”, as Winston Churchill famously called him, is a face probably better recognized than those of most Bollywood actors.

Politically irrelevant after he guided India to independence, Gandhi’s legacy at home has been constantly debated. However, his contribution to India’s global image is unparalleled.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs British India broke into two and millions of people perished in pre- and post-partition violence, Gandhi, shunned by his disciples, virtually retired, bitterly complaining that nobody listened to him anymore. His murder, by a religious fanatic, however, changed the course of events. In his death he achieved what he couldn’t when he lived—bring a turbulent nation together and stop the gory dance of violence that had enveloped the infant republic.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHis martyrdom eventually put him on history’s high pedestal and made him acceptable globally as an apostle of peace, ensuring his brand of politics remained relevant. In India, politicians, convulsing against his political thought, consigned him to school text books—bringing him alive on his death and birth anniversaries for formal ceremonies that involved the twice annual ritual of cleaning bird droppings from his statues and naming public schemes after him.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EA different path\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFrank Moraes, the editor of \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Times of India\\u003C/em\\u003E, recounted a conversation with HSL Polak—one of Gandhi’s close associates in South Africa—in an article he wrote for the \\u003Cem\\u003EForeign Affairs\\u003C/em\\u003E journal to mark the Mahatma’s 10\\u003Csup\\u003Eth\\u003C/sup\\u003E death anniversary in 1958. He asked Polak how much of Gandhi’s teaching he thought survived in India. “Ostensibly a great deal… In reality, very little,” said Polak.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, neither India nor the Congress Party ever accepted Gandhi’s doctrine of non-violence as creed. “The Congress Party, including Nehru and other prominent leaders such as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, accepted non-violence but only as a method. With them it was an instrument of political practice, not an article of faith,” wrote Moraes.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the 56 years since his article, the situation has only worsened. Very little of the Mahatma\\u0026#8217;s politics has survived in India; we could, however, despite our reluctance, take pride in our ability to export an enduring brand. It is perhaps more relevant to the world than to India, mostly because we have chosen to take a path different from his.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat probably was a good reason why Richard Attenborough’s film on the man many Britons hated won the Oscar for best film. That probably was also the reason for the U.S. Congress to pass a special legislation allowing the Mahatma’s statute in Washington to be installed on government land.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile we, as a nation, use him on occasions of political exigencies, the world only wants more of Gandhi for his political thought.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMyriad Mahatmas\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, the metallic Mahatma is much in demand. Under a well-structured programme run jointly by India’s overseas missions, which work out the modalities of the placement of statues and busts, and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) that pays the sculptors who make the statutes, replicas of the bespectacled apostle of peace are regularly shipped to the world.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBetween 2001 and 2010, nearly 70 busts and statues of the Mahatma were sent to dozens of countries by the ICCR. That’s an average of seven a year. The bust I saw in Djibouti was sent in 2003 for installation on a street named after the Mahatma. The cigar chewing Mr. Churchill, who never regretted his long-time rival’s death, hasn’t had it so good!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Mahatma’s statue is due to be unveiled at the Parliament Square in London next year alongside those of Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela—the man who was so influenced by Gandhi as he led his people to an apartheid-free South Africa. Churchill’s statue is one of the 10 already erected at this place.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EOwning Gandhi\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHere, at home, he still has an occasional use. The stamp of moral authority that he has left on this nation means the Mahatma—though a Congress man—can be greedily adopted by other political parties when required. Modi’s effort to make him the face of his “Clean India” campaign is just another example of Gandhi’s use for political convenience.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDespite promising to build a towering statue of Patel in the run up to the general elections that swept him to power, Modi now wants his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to own “Brand Gandhi” and take over the events that mark the death and birth anniversaries of the Mahatma. Up until now, these ceremonies were the responsibility of a special committee constituted by an Act of parliament.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Mahatma’s adoption by the BJP—the political face of an organization whose members celebrated the Mahatma’s death—is ironic, but then that’s the strength of a brand that has endured the rough and tumble of time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"edition-credit india\\\"\\u003EThis article is a part of Quartz India.

Taxes didn’t go up despite our decade-long engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. The resulting disconnect between the military and the civilian population has been cited as a source of concern by General Stan McChrystal, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and many others. MSNBC host Chris Hayes points out that the proportion of congressmen who had served in the military is now lower than for the population at large, while the reverse had been true up to 1995; we also have shown a greater propensity to project military force since around the same time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI don’t recall a single person from my time at either Exeter or Brown who went into the armed forces. One woman the year below me at Columbia Law School joined the JAG Corps afterwards—I remember this in part because she was so unusual. For people who graduated from Brown or similar institutions, the notion of \\u0026#8220;service\\u0026#8221; tends to take less the form of \\u0026#8220;join the army\\u0026#8221; and more \\u0026#8220;go help some people.\\u0026#8221; Although Harvard, Yale, and Columbia have recently reinstated ROTC, there are more prevalent non-military service options for students, including Teach for America, the Peace Corps, City Year, and similar programs and organizations. The message is that service means working with children, teaching the poor, working at a non-profit and that sort of activity.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI’ll confess that I never realistically considered any of these options when I graduated from college in the mid-90s. I went directly to law school and became a corporate attorney. I did a few things such that I still felt somewhat pro-social (e.g., I took on a pro bono asylum case for an indigent woman, volunteered for friends’ organizations when asked), but these activities were peripheral to the basic cause of succeeding professionally.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI’m far from unique. There are a ton of young people whose goal it is to get a good job at a good firm, pay some bills, get a date, get an apartment, buy some furniture, etc. and maybe volunteer on the side. These impulses are healthy and positive. Teddy Roosevelt remarked that a man’s first duty is to provide for himself and his family; only after this has been done can he be of service to the general public. Today, with women experiencing higher educational attainment than men, I’m sure the same could be applied across gender lines.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter arriving at the law firm though, I found practicing corporate law to be a poor fit. It wasn’t because I wasn’t helping people or doing something noble. The problem for me was that my work felt fungible and pointless. I wasn’t creating any value. My reviewing documents was a transaction cost. Someone else could step in and take my place and the world would be exactly the same.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI left to co-found a startup, Stargiving.com, that used the internet to help celebrities raise money more effectively for their favorite non-profits using sponsored clicks (\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://freerice.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ethink freerice.com\\u003C/a\\u003E but with celebrities offering to meet people who clicked on their cause). The company didn’t work out, I’m sure in part because I had little idea what I was doing. I went from there to a mobile software company and a health care software company, eventually becoming the CEO of Manhattan GMAT, a test prep company that was acquired by the Washington Post.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI could say that these roles were about helping people (raising money for charities, making hospitals more efficient, helping young people achieve their goals, etc.) but that wasn’t why I did any of them. The important factor was that I thought I was making a difference for the organization each day. I just wanted to feel that my work mattered, and that I was developing in a direction I wanted to go. It was less about the activity itself and more about what I was accomplishing.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt least for me, the metrics were less about \\u0026#8220;am I helping people?”—it was more, was I creating value? Am I having an impact? Did I value the people around me? Was I becoming a better person or professional over time? If I stopped showing up, would it matter? I founded Venture for America in large part to drive our talented young people to environments where they could answer these questions in a positive way. Venture for America channels enterprising graduates to early-stage companies in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans, St. Louis and other US cities to promote job growth and train the next generation of entrepreneurs. Our goal is to help create 100,000 new US jobs by 2025.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPeople who enlist for military service or devote their lives to the unfortunate are clearly worthy of praise and admiration. At the same time, military service isn’t a realistic option for many, and I’ve seen tons of idealistic young people go work for large non-profits and organizations only to become frustrated with their roles or burnt out. In my view, if we broaden the notion of service to include \\u0026#8220;helping organizations succeed,\\u0026#8221; \\u0026#8220;creating value,\\u0026#8221; and \\u0026#8220;generating new opportunities for yourself and others,\\u0026#8221; we’ll give many young people license to take on pursuits that are more sustainable for them and will drive society forward.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EJob creation and paths to the middle class are today what our economy and society need most. If you examine our communities, what we need as much as anything else are new companies that help enliven neighborhoods and give people meaningful avenues for personal advancement. Nothing conveys a sense of self-worth like the right opportunity. This is the new call to service—“Can you create 5, or 50, or 500 jobs for people in Detroit, New Orleans, Providence, or Baltimore?” Success will drive our ability to educate our children and many other things.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s time we posed a different vision of service to our young people that addresses the needs of today. Business formation and economic dynamism are at record lows. We need new businesses to drive job creation and new opportunities. If our young people decide to take on the challenge of revitalizing our country’s economy, they’ll grow to become precisely the kind of people and builders we need them to be.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe challenge that lies ahead is to make the path to entrepreneurship as well-lit and supported as other more conventional paths. Imagine if we gave each aspiring entrepreneur the same level of support and resources that currently go to aspiring lawyers and doctors, both of which often receive $100,000+ apiece in federally subsidized education loans and praise from all around them. In my experience, entrepreneurship is a lonely endeavor. We can make it less so and make it possible to serve both oneself and society.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EYou can follow Andrew on Twitter at \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/AndrewYangVFA\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E@AndrewYangVFA\\u003C/a\\u003E.

So to make these determinations, it relied solely on the data it collected in the previous year from billions of search results displayed on its website. This means that the buy-two-weeks-in-advance figure it gave us this year was actually the best time to buy last year. It also means that when Kayak said that the best time to buy in 2013 was 12 weeks out, they were off by 10 weeks.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn average, a flyer who followed Kayak\\u0026#8217;s advice last year would have paid 4.6% more for the fare than if they were able to buy at the time of lowest fares.

Including fare results from within two weeks of travel, the range expanded—to 32% above the lowest fare.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESo how is this year shaping up? Does it look more like last year or 2012? After repeated requests from Quartz, Kayak declined to provide data from its search results in 2014, which could better shed light on current pricing trends. Kayak says that looking at the previous year\\u0026#8217;s data is the best way to predict when to buy, and that the 2014 data is \\u0026#8220;not actionable\\u0026#8221; because it\\u0026#8217;s incomplete and backward looking.

Dilma Rousseff, the incumbent, runs against Senator Aécio Neves, who promised “safe change” after 12 years of Worker’s Party rule. Environmentalist Marina Silva, the proponent of “the new politics,” looked like she would make it to the runoff until the last minute. But the great winner of these elections is the old Brazilian politics—and that’s a good thing.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMarina’s politics above parties, congregating people of good will from all sectors of society around common goals, could have echoed the voices of the June 2013 national protests—spontaneous demonstrations that brought major Brazilian cities to a halt and caught by surprise established parties and major social movements. But voters chose someone else to run against former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s protégé.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAécio Neves presented himself as the candidate of the established political structure—his Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira\\u003Cem\\u003E \\u003C/em\\u003Eis a major national party with solid footing in important states like São Paulo and Minas Gerais, consistently in the opposition since Lula’s election in 2002. During the campaign, he built his candidacy the old way, spending time talking to local political leaders and neglecting until the last minute the fashionable social media as a vehicle to reach voters.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAécio brought back the memory of his grandfather Tancredo Neves, one of the greatest architects of the transition to democracy which took place in the mid-1980s. Inserting himself in the progressive and democratic Brazilian political history, the PSDB candidate often cited Juscelino Kubitschek, Brazilian president during the 1950s and builder of Brasília, who like Aécio was a Minas Gerais native and a bon vivant. The active participation of former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso during the campaign also helped Aécio to appear as heir to a proud tradition and not as an inaugurator of a new era, as the Worker’s Party has repeatedly done. The narrative he presents in the campaign, more than one of a competent public official, is of a Ulysses who comes back just in time to prevent rogues from ruining his land.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe importance of his election cannot be overstated. In Brazil, it represents a return to traditional politics and to negotiations with legislators and political parties. Regionally, the spotlights will turn from Bolivarian speeches toward Brazilian investment figures. Given the size of the country, there will be no need for an abrupt reorientation of foreign policy to show where South America is headed. Symbolically, though, the return of an established democratic party to the federal administration will be even more significant, both nationally and internationally: it tells Brazil, our neighbors, and the world that formal democracy is alive and kicking.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPolitical use of social programs, subsidies and public expenses channeled to friendly private companies during the past governments of Lula (2003-10) and Dilma (2011-14) failed to bring Brazilians together in an egalitarian common project, which has always been the Worker’s Party professed goal. The presidential decree institutionalizing civil society councils in the various agencies of the federal administration was probably the final blow to this “new politics.” Instead of responding to the June 2013 protests, the councils were perceived as a further method of segregating “them” who are in power from “us” who are excluded.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe foreign observer might use economic and political divisions of right and left to understand these elections, but these labels don’t shed light on the present dispute or others in the region: Aécio assured he will not change social benefits. Conversely, the Worker’s Party repeated promised that inflation will not return. If elected, Aécio will certainly take care of financial stability, will search for advantageous trade agreements and will try to help entrepreneurs big and small with less bureaucracy and lower taxes. His emphasis on predictability and transparency of public policies signals something else: citizens will be on equal foot under his government and walls built by the “new politics” of the last decade will be dissolved.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAécio is bringing back the modernizing and democratic political ideas of the great Brazilian presidents and appealing to Brazilian values of conversation and tolerance. In the process, he is also shelving the revisionist history that claims that the ideological armed struggle saved Brazilian democracy, which was actually rebuilt by skillful negotiations and social movements organized in the open. With these inclusive values, he might very well bring to the nation a sense of belonging and rebuild a tie between state and society that has been weakened by the corruption scandals occupying the headlines for almost a decade, and poorly reinforced by income transferences to the poor and easy credit for the emerging middle class.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe challenge for “old politics” now is to bring the Brazilian political culture to the 21st century, incorporating serious issues such as the environment, minority rights and a communications revolution while firmly rejecting the co-option of social movements and the democratic erosion of today. It seems that Marina’s demands to join in Aécio’s campaign will bring him to the green side. PSDB must bring women, blacks and minorities to its ranks if it wants to keep up with transformations in Brazilian society taking place for already 40 years. Finally, the thoughtful use of new means of communication can bring legislative debates closer to the large Brazilian electorate as well as illuminate the increasingly complex executive actions of a modern state, and the renewal of the traditional representative politics.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EFollow Heloisa on Twitter\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/helopait\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E@helopait\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at \\u003Ca href=\\\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=284257\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/284257/the-real-winner-of-brazils-elections-is-democracy/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-10-21T08:00:43-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=284257\",\"dc_creator\":\"Heloisa Pait\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/rtr4awdq.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Dilma-crowd\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/rtr4awdq.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/284257/the-real-winner-of-brazils-elections-is-democracy/"], ["published_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 12:00:43 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The real winner of Brazil&#8217;s elections is democracy"], ["updated_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 15:58:04 UTC +00:00]]
